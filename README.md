Exploratory Data Analysis

Visualized battery capacity, range, and efficiency

Plotted top 20 cities with most charging stations

Created interactive map of stations across India using Plotly

Key Insights

Range increases with battery capacity

Stations are mainly in metro areas (Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru)

Sparse coverage in North-East and rural regions

Tools Used
